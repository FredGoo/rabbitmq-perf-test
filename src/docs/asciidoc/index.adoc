PerfTest is a throughput testing tool for RabbitMQ

== Introduction

RabbitMQ has a throughput testing tool, PerfTest, that is based on
the Java client and can be configured to simulate basic
workloads and more advanced workloads as well.
PerfTest has extra tools that produce HTML graphs of the output.

A RabbitMQ cluster can be limited by a number of factors,
from infrastructure-level constraints (e.g. network bandwidth) to
RabbitMQ configuration and topology to applications that publish
and consume. PerfTest can demonstrate baseline performance of a
node or a cluster of nodes.
